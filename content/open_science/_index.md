### Commitment to Research Transparency and Open Science

"_Open Science encompasses the entire research process and the entire research community. It empowers researchers everywhere to share valuable artifacts from each stage of their investigation and increase visibility and collaboration around their work. Every research community and individual has an opportunity to shape the activities and norms that inspire trust in their work. A commitment to Open Science, therefore, is not a pledge to adopt a few specific behaviors, but to advance openness, transparency and reproducibility in daily life as a researcher_" (<https://plos.org/commit-to-openness/>)

Signatory of the Commitment to Research Transparency:

"_I embrace the values of openness and transparency in science. I believe that such research practices increase the informational value and impact of my research, as the data can be reanalyzed and synthesized in future studies. Furthermore, they increase the credibility of the results, as independent verification of the findings is possible_" (Schönbrodt, F. D., Maier, M., Heene, M., & Zehetleitner, M. (2015). Commitment to research transparency. Retrieved from <http://www.researchtransparency.org>).
