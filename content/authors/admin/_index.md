<!-- add a brief description of your research interests and project -->

I am an ecologist with a particular interest for birds as study species. I aim to answer questions related to the effects of climate change on animals using long-term individual-based datasets. Recently, I have been getting more and more engaged in Open Science and Reproducibility practices.

Currently, I am a postdoc at the Swiss Ornithological Institute (Switzerland) and my project aims at investigating and explaining the recent changes in body size and shape of Alpine swifts (_Tachymarptis melba_) and assessing the short- and long-term effects of these changes.

I have just finished a Marie Skłodowska-Curie global fellowship, with a project that saw the collaboration between the [M.A.D. Lab](https://juliengamartin.github.io/) (Prof. Julien Martin, University of Ottawa, Canada) and the [Bize Lab](https://www.vogelwarte.ch/en/team/pierre-bize/) (Dr. Pierre Bize, Swiss Ornithological Institute - Vogelwarte Sempach, Switzerland). This project received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Sklodowska-Curie grant agreement No 101025938, project name CLIMGROWTH. Link to the [official page](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/101025938).

Apart from the research work, I am (or have been) involved in the work of some Ornithological Societies, Open Science societies and promoting women in Science. All my activities can be found either in the [Open Science]({{< relref "/open_science" >}}) or in the [Other Activities]({{< relref "/other/other_activities" >}}) sections of my website.

In my free time, you can probably find me hiking in a nice forest or up a mountain, watching birds and other animals, or relaxing in the sun while reading a book. Random news and chats on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/giumasoero.bsky.social) and [GitHub](https://github.com/giuliamasoero).
